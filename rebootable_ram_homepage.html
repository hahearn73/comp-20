	<div class=section_titles>Why Rebootable RAM?</div>
	<div class=para>Random Access Memory (RAM) is what holds the data in your programs while your computer is on. 
	However, all of that data is lost the second power stops being passed through. This can lead to huge losses 
	of data as the result of any failures in the electric grid or simply a short circuit from within your own system.
	For everyday Users, this is not a problem. But for your large scale calculations, any loss of data can mean hours
	of lost compute time, and late decisions for your company or R&D team. <b>Rebootable RAM is what 
	you need</b>. </div>
